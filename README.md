# Welcome to PyFlowgo

Lava flow advance may be modeled through tracking the evolution of the lava's thermo-rheological properties, which are defined by viscosity and yield strength. These rheological properties evolve, in turn, with cooling and crystallization. Such model was conceived by Harris and Rowland who developed a 1-D model, FLOWGO, in which velocity of a control volume flowing down a channel depends on rheological properties computed following the lava cooling and crystallization path estimated via a heat balance box model. 

PyFlowGo is an updated version of FLOWGO written in Python 3, that is open-source and compatible with any operating system.
